# Module 6: Monitoring Azure Network

## Exercise 3: Run Sample traffic and perform traffic analytics, review logs

In this task, you will enable the Traffic Analytics in the NSG flow logs and review the logs.
 
## Task 1: Run sample traffic

1. Navigate to the resource group **<inject key="Resource Group" enableCopy="false"/>**, from **Overview(1)** tab select the **<inject key="Loadbalancer" enableCopy="false"/>(2)**.

   ![loadbalancer](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/lb1.png?raw=true)
     
2. Now select the **Overview (1)** tab from the load balancer page and select the **Public IP address (2)**.

   ![pip](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/lbpip.png?raw=true)
      
3. Navigate to the load balancer's public IP address and generate some traffic by refreshing the browser.

## Task 2: Perform Traffic Analytics and review logs

4. Now search for the **Network Watcher** from Azure Portal's **Home** page and select it.

   ![net](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/network%20watcher.png?raw=true)
      
5. Select **NSG flow logs**, under **Logs** from the options on the left side of the Network Watcher blade.

   ![network watcher](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/logs.png?raw=true)
     
6. Now select the created NSG flow log.

   ![nsg](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/nsflowlog.png?raw=true)
       
7. Under the **Flow log settings** page, follow the below steps:

     - Check the box next to **Enable traffic Analytics (1)**

     - Traffic Analytics processing interval: Select **Every 10 min (2)** from the drop-down list

     - Subscription : Select your **Subscription (3)**

     - Log Analytics Workspace: Select **LogAnalyticsWorkspace (4)** from the drop-down list

     - Select **Save (5)**

       ![log](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/flowlogset.png?raw=true)

8. Select **Traffic Analytics**, under **Logs** from the options on the left side of the Network Watcher blade.

   ![netwat](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/traffic.png?raw=true)
      
9. On the **Traffic Analytics** page, set the time interval to **Last 1 hour**.

   ![time interval](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/timeinterval.png?raw=true)
      
10. Now, you can observe the total number of network traffic flows from **Traffic Visualization**

    > **Note**: The dashboard may take up to 30 minutes to appear when deployed for the first time. This is because the Traffic Analytics must first aggregate enough data for it to derive meaningful insights.
      
      ![traffic visualization](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/total.png?raw=true)
     
11. Under **Traffic Analytics** Scroll down to **Your Environment** to view the total number of **Deployed Azure Regions (1)**, **Virtual networks (2)**, **Enabled NSGs (3)**, **Virtual Subnets (4)**.

    ![env](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/env.png?raw=true)
      
12. To visualize the traffic distribution by geography, click on **View map**. The geo-map shows the traffic distribution to a data center from countries/regions and continents communicating to it.

    ![map](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/map.png?raw=true)
     
13. In the **Traffic Analytics Geo Map View** page, click on the **Green** icon which indicates the Azure region, and observe the resources deployed under the region, to explore more select **More details**.

    ![md](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/md.png?raw=true)
      
14. Under **More Insights** blade, scroll down and explore traffic distribution for deployments of the East US region.

    ![comm](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/comm.png?raw=true)
     
15. To close the **Traffic Analytics Geo Map View**, click on the cross at the top right corner.

     ![close](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/close.png?raw=true)
      
16. Now, from the **Your Environment** section, select **Ports receiving traffic from the internet**.

    ![ports](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/TTI.png?raw=true)
      
17. From the **Ports receiving traffic from Internet** page, you can explore more about the ports associated with the resources.

    ![ports](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/prt.png?raw=true)
      
18. Close the **Ports receiving traffic from Internet** page by clicking the **Cross (X) icon** from the top right corner.
      
18. Under the Traffic Analytics page, scroll down to **Traffic Distribution** to view the analytics of traffic flows across host, subnet, VNet, and VMSS.

    ![tr](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/trdi.png?raw=true)
     
19. To view the analytics of traffic flows across the host, select **IP (1)**, then select **See all (2)** from **Traffic Distribution**.

    ![td](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/td.png?raw=true)
    
20. You can observe the graph of **Time trending chart for top 5 talking IPs** from **Traffic distribution across top IPs** page.

    ![see more](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/time.png?raw=true)
    
21. Under **Details of top 5 talking IPs**, select VM IP to explore more about traffic distribution.

     ![see more](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/ip.png?raw=true)
     
22. Close the **Traffic distribution across top IPs** by clicking the **cross (X) icon** at the top-left corner of the page.
    
23. In the same way, you can explore more about **Subnets**, **VNet**, **VMSS**.

24. Now scroll down to **Application ports**, to view analytics for application ports utilized across your environment and select **See all**.

    ![ap](https://github.com/Divyasri199/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/prod/media/ap1.png?raw=true)
     
25. From the **Most frequent L7 protocols** page, you can explore more about the ports and it's ranging.
