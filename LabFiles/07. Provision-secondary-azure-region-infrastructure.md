# Exercise 6:  Provision Secondary Azure Region Infrastructure 
 
 Duration: 20-30 mins
 
 ## Scenario
 
 Contoso Application is growing in popularity around the world, so they need a backup infrastructure incase of primary region failure. Contoso wishes to set up a secondary region in case the first region fails, and the virtual machines in the primary and secondary regions should be able to communicate over a private network.

 In this section, you will help Contoso in setting up secondary region infrastructure and configure peering connection that allows virtual machine's in primary and secondary to communicate securely on private network
 
 ## Overview
 
Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between virtual machines in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's private network only. To lear more about Vnet peering refer to : ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview```
 
 In this exercise, you'll create a Virtual Network in secondary region and deploy a VM within the Vnet. You'll also configure Peering connections between the Vnets and test inter-VM connectivity on your private network.
 
 This exercise includes the following tasks:
 
*  [Task 1 : Provision Virtual Network – 2 (Region-2)](#task-1-provision-virtual-network--2-region-2)

*  [Task 2 : Provision Sample VM in VNET-2](#task-2-provision-sample-vm-in-vnet-2)

*  [Task 3 : Configure VNET Peering](#task-3-configure-vnet-peering)

*  [Task 4 : Validate Inter VM Connectivity on private network](#task-4-validate-inter-vm-connectivity-on-a-private-network)

## Task 1: Provision Virtual Network – 2 (Region-2)

In this task, you will create a virtual network in the secondary region.

## Task 2: Provision Sample VM in VNET-2

In this task, you will deploy Sample VM in the existing virtual network that you deployed in the previous task.

1. Copy and paste the below Link in the new tab of your browser and launch the template deployment. Log in to the Azure portal using your subscription credentials if you are prompted to do so.

    ```
    https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCloudLabsAI-Azure%2FAIW-Azure-Network-Solutions%2Fmain%2Ftemplate%2Fcontoso-iaas-region2.json
   ```
    
1. Select the Resource group **rg-contoso-prod-westus(1)** from drop-downlist and click on **Review + create(2)**.

    ![vm2](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/vnet2create.png?raw=true)
    
1. Click on **Create**.

    ![vm3](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/r+c4.png?raw=true)
     
1. While you wait for the resources to deploy, take some time review the template contents. Navigate to Templates and observe the resources which are deploying.

    ![template](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/template1.png?raw=true)
    
    Note that the template contains five resources. Using custom script extenion, you are deploying the web application
   
1. After the template has been successfully created, click Go to resource group.

   > Note: The template will take up to 15 minutes to deploy.

   ![goto](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/resource.png?raw=true)
     

## Task 3: Configure VNET Peering

In this task, you will configure a peering connection between the two virtual networks that you created earlier.

1. Select **vm-contoso-app-prod-westus-001** from the overview page of the Resource Group **rg-contoso-prod-westus**

    ![vm2](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/vmwest.png?raw=true)

1. From the **Overview** tab of **<inject key="samplevm" enableCopy="false"/>**, select **Virtual network/subnet**.

    - Peering link name: **vnet-peering-eastus-westus-001**

    - Traffic to remote virtual network: **Allow (default)**

    - Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network: **Allow (default)**

    - Peering link name (Remote virtual network): **vnet-peering-westus-eastus-001**

    - Virtual Network: **vnet-contoso-prod-eastus-001**

    - Traffic to remote virtual network: **Allow (default)**

    - Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network: **Allow (default)**
    
    - Click on **Add**

      ![peering](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/peering2.png?raw=true)


## Task 4: Validate Inter VM Connectivity on a private network. 

In this task, you will test the inter VM connectivity by connecting to the virtual machine in the primary network then initiating a connection to the virtual machine in the secondary network using a private IP address.
1. Navigate back to the Resource Group **rg-contoso-prod-westus** and select **vm-contoso-app-prod-westus-001** from the overview page.

    ![vm](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/rgg.png?raw=true)
   
3. From the **Overview (1)** of **<inject key="samplevm" enableCopy="false"/>**, select **Connect (2)** to connect the VM using **RDP**

     ![vmto rdp](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/rdpf.png?raw=true)
     
4. Select **Download RDP File** and then open it once it has been downloaded.

     ![rdp](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/downloadd.png?raw=true)
     
5. When you are prompted with the Remote Desktop Connection box, select **Connect**

     ![connect](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/connect.png?raw=true)
     
6. To login into the Virtual Machine use these credentials:

     - Username: **demouser**

     - Password: **Password.1!!**

7. If you are asked with a dialogue box after entering your credentials, select **Yes**.

8. Now, from your Azure Portal navigate to the resource group **rg-contoso-prod-eastus** and select private IP Address of **vm-contoso-app-prod-westus-002** from the overview page

     ![privateip](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/privateipa.png?raw=true)
     
9. Now, from the samplevm search for the **Remote desktop app** and select it.

     ![rdp](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/rdpconnection.png?raw=true)
 
10. Now, provide the **Private IP address (1)** that you copied in the **step-8** and and click on **Connect**.

     ![private](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/enterip.png?raw=true)
     
11. Use the same credentials as in **step 6** to connect to the Remote Desktop App.

     - Username : **demouser**

     - Password: **Password.1!!**

12.  Notice that you can connect to the VM using a private IP address which means you've successfully set up inter-VM connectivity on your private network.


### Summary
