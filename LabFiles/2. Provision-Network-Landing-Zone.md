# Exercise 2: Provision Network Landing Zone

Duration: 15 mins

## Scenario 

Contoso is planning to set up its infrastructure on Azure. Contoso needs to deploy a Network landing zone (virtual network) to host their resources, since Contoso has wide range of plans to expand their Azure footprint to different resources they require multiple subnets to support different scenarios.

## Overview

An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a network or environment that can be used to run VMs and applications in the cloud. When it is created, the services and Virtual Machines within the Azure network interact securely with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation. You can find more references about  virtual network from here: ```https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/```

A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security.

In this exercise, you will create a Virtual Network and subnets for different scenarios like AVD, DMZ, Internal, and AzureFirewallSubnet.



This exercise includes the following tasks:

* [Task 1: Provision Virtual Network](#task-1-provision-virtual-network)
* [Task 2: Provision of subnets](#task-2-provision-of-subnets)


## Task 1: Provision Virtual Network 

In this task, you will create a virtual network.

1.  In the Azure Portal, from the upper left corner select **Show portal menu(1)** and then select **Create a resource(2)**.

2.  In the search box, search for **Virtual Network** and click on it to select.

3.  Click on **Create**.

4. On the **Basics** tab of **Create virtual network**, enter the following information and select **Next: IP Addresses**.

    -  **Subscription:** *Select your subscription*
  
    -  **Resource group:** Select **<inject key="Resource Group" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group from the drop down list

    -  **Name:**  Enter **<inject key="VnetName" enableCopy="false"/>**

    -  **Location:** Select *(US) East US*

5.  On the **IP Addresses** tab enter the below details:

     - **IPv4 address space (1):** **10.1.0.0/16**
     
     - Click on **Add subnet (2)** and follow the below instructions:
  
         - Subnet name (3): **snet-prod-eastus-internalserver**
         - Subnet address range (4): **10.1.0.0/24**
         - Click on **Add (5)**
        
     - Select **Review + create (6)**
     
    ![move to IP address](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/subnet.png?raw=true)

6. Review the configuration and select **Create**.

7. Monitor the deployment status by selecting the **Notifications Bell (1)** icon at the top of the portal. In a minute or so, you should see a confirmation of the successful deployment. Select **Go to resource (2)**.

## Task 2: Provision of subnets

In this task, you will create a Subnet for different scenarios like AVD, DMZ, AzureFirewallSubnet. 

1.  Select **Subnets(1)** from <inject key="VnetName" enableCopy="false"/> the lest navigation menu and Click on **+Subnet(2)**.

      ![Subnet](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/select%20subnet.png?raw=true)
      
2. Provide the following instructions under **Add Subnet** to create **AVD** subnet.

    - Name : **snet-prod-eastus-avd(1)**
    
    - Subnet Address Range : **10.1.1.0/24 (2)**
    
    - Select **Save (3)**

    ![AVD](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/avdsubnet.png?raw=true)
    
3. Repeat **step-1** for creating the **DMZ** subnet and provide the below-mentioned instructions.

    - Name : **snet-prod-eastus-dmz (1)**
    
    - Subnet Address Range : **10.1.2.0/24 (2)**
    
    - Select **Save (3)**

    ![DMZ](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/dmzsubnet.png?raw=true)
    
    
4. Repeat **step-1** for creating **AzureFirewallSubnet** subnet and provide the below-mentioned instructions. You will use this subnet in the further exercises.

    - Name : **AzureFirewallSubnet (1)**
    
    - Subnet Address Range : **10.1.3.0/24 (2)** 
    
    - Select **Save (3)**
