## Task 4: Test Application for security and perform sample attack(XSS)

In this task, you will be testing your application for security and perform sample attacks like XSS. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end-user.

1. You can perform a sample attack on your application by passing this **?q=<script>** value at the end of the web application URL or IP address.
    
2. Now pass the value **?q=<script>** at the end of your **Firewall** IP and try browsing it. Notice you can still access the webpage.
  
   > **Note** : Your browsing URL value should look ```http://20.185.224.102/q=<script>```

 4. Under the **Application gateway** page, follow the below details:
     - Select **Web application firewall** under **Settings**    
     - Under **Configure** balde, set Firewall Status as **Enabled** and Firewall mode as **Prevention**.   
  
     ![config](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/config.png?raw=true)

     - Now move to **Rules (1)** blade    
     - Advanced rule configuration: **Enabled (2)**    
     - Select **Save (3)**
    
     ![save](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-Azure-Network-Solutions/blob/main/media/enable.png?raw=true)
    
 5. Now, navigate back to the tab where you browsed the IP Address and refresh the page. You can observe the Server Error.
